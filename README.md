### This app was developed using
 - ExpressJS
 - TypeScript
 - Postgres
 - React
 - Redux (react-redux)
 - [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts)


I made this small application in order to learn about Redux, Typescript and using a relational database (Postgres).

Instead of doing all the filtering directly on the client side I decided query the postgres db with the user input in order to filter and sort the Pokemons (just to practice writing SQL queries)

TypeScript is used both on the server and the client (with react and redux).

The Pokemon data that is being used is from the PokeAPI but stored on a Heroku Postgres DB.
